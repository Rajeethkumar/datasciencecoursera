1. First pull the data and set the seed.    
2. The data contains NA values and timestamp which is not available in test data set so remove the unanted columns as the process of feature engineering.  
3. Once data is ready e split the training into tow parts one for training and another one for cross validation.  
4. We start to build models by strating from Decision tree classfier and build Random forest as well as Graddient boosting,finaly we look at the pretictions and plots.   
5. We use cross validation test for validdation purpose.
6. We predict "Classe" fro given test data set.
