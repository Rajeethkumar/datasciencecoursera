1. First pull the data and set the seed.    
2. The data contains NA values and timestamp which is not available in test data set so remove the unwanted columns as the process of feature engineering.  
3. Once data is ready we split the training into two parts one for training and another one for cross validation.  
4. We start to build models by strating from Decision tree classfier and build Random forest as well as Graddient boosting,finaly we look at the pretictions and plots.   
5. We use cross validation test for validation purpose.
6. We predict "Classe" for given test data set.
